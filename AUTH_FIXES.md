# Authentication Fixes Needed

## Current Issues
1. Sign-in functionality is not working properly with Supabase
2. "Invalid API key" error when attempting to sign up or sign in

## Required Fixes

### 1. Supabase Configuration
- [ ] Verify Supabase project settings in the Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Ensure the correct API keys are being used
- [ ] Check if the project is properly set up for email authentication

### 2. Environment Variables
- [ ] Create proper `.env` file with correct Supabase credentials:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
  ```
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are being loaded correctly in the application

### 3. Authentication Flow
- [ ] Review and fix the sign-up process in `src/services/authService.ts`
- [ ] Review and fix the sign-in process in `src/services/authService.ts`
- [ ] Add proper error handling for authentication failures
- [ ] Implement proper session management

### 4. Database Setup
- [ ] Verify the `profiles` table exists in Supabase
- [ ] Ensure proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies are in place
- [ ] Check if the database schema matches the application's requirements

### 5. Testing Steps
1. Test sign-up flow:
   - Create new account
   - Verify email (if enabled)
   - Check if profile is created

2. Test sign-in flow:
   - Sign in with valid credentials
   - Check session persistence
   - Verify user data loading

3. Test sign-out flow:
   - Sign out functionality
   - Session cleanup

## Additional Notes
- The application is currently running on port 8083 (or another available port)
- Make sure to test the authentication flow in both development and production environments
- Consider implementing proper error messages for users when authentication fails
